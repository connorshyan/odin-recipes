# The Odin Project - Foundation Project: Recipes

This project is to practice building a basic recipe website using HTML. It will contain a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website will look very basic as it only uses HTML and nothing else. This project will be revisited in the near future to be styled using CSS.
